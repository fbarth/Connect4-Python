# Connect4-Python

Connect 4 programmed in python using pygame.

## Why I forked this project?

Because I would like an user interface for my agents that know how to play Connect-4. 

## Running

````bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

The game is started by running `connect4.py` or `connect4_with_ai.py`.
